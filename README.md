# ACT scores analsis
Tyler Cowen wrote a post [commenting on the fact that](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/04/west-virginia-fact-day-comments.html) "West Virginiaâ€™s average ACT score and percentage taking the test are almost identical to the national average."

Upon inspection, it looked like the percentage of people who took the test in a given state strongly predicted average score;
given that, it was not particularly surprising that WV would fall in the middle of one category conidtional on falling in the middle of the other. I wrote a little bit of R code to demonstrate that. 

It's a strong relationship, to say the least:
![All states](https://github.com/setgree/ACT_score_analysis/blob/master/ACT.png)

The relationship holds when you look both at all states (R^2 = 0.7119) and also those with less than 100% ACT takeup (R^2 = 0.6083) -- those in which the test is optional, I'm presuming. I'm not sure which dataset is more informative/theoretically interesting. 

I created filepaths consistent with use for [Code Ocean](codeocean.com), where I will port this in time.

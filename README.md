Does ACT takeup predict ACT scores? (yes) 
Tyler Cowen [wrote a post about ACT scores in West Virginia](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/04/west-virginia-fact-day-comments.html).

Upon in spection, it looked like the percentage of people who took the test in a given state strongly predicted average score;
given that, it was not particularly surprising that WV would fall in the middle of one category conidtional on falling in the middle of the other.
I wrote a little bit of R code to demonstrate that. 

The relationship holds when you look both at all states and also those with less than 100% ACT takeup -- those in which the test is optional, I'm presuming.

It's a strong relationship, to say the least: 



I created filepaths consistent with use for [[Code Ocean]]. where I will port this in time.

# ACT scores analsis
Tyler Cowen [wrote a post about ACT scores in West Virginia](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/04/west-virginia-fact-day-comments.html), commenting on the fact that "West Virginiaâ€™s average ACT score and percentage taking the test are almost identical to the national average."

Upon inspection, it looked like the percentage of people who took the test in a given state strongly predicted average score;
given that, it was not particularly surprising that WV would fall in the middle of one category conidtional on falling in the middle of the other. I wrote a little bit of R code to demonstrate that. 

The relationship holds when you look both at all states and also those with less than 100% ACT takeup -- those in which the test is optional, I'm presuming.

It's a strong relationship, to say the least:

I created filepaths consistent with use for [Code Ocean](codeocean.com), where I will port this in time.
